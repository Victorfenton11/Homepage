            Here are the college essays that I wrote for 4/6 of the schools that I got into (The rest are pretty much repeated).
            They are very cheesy and cringy so bare with me. Don't try to copy them or whatever.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <strong style="font-size: 24px">Common App:</strong> <br>
            <strong>Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be
            incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story:</strong> <br> <br>

            Tomorrow, the wait would finally be over. Every 5th grader’s big day had come: the annual talent show, the opportunity to impress all your classmates with your abilities.
            <br> <br>
            For a second, eagerness and excitement skimmed through my mind; before all hell broke loose. What was it that made me special? I had been so anxious for the moment to come that I completely oversaw planning what my act was going to be.
            <br> <br>
            Every other kid in the class had planned the moment ahead. Athletes would show their dribbles, musicians would play their instruments and comedians would tell their jokes.
            <br> <br>
            I had nothing. Not a single idea. I played soccer, I could play the piano and I knew some funny jokes, but I didn’t think those things were good enough to impress everyone. With less than 24 hours on the clock, my body brimmed with pressure and fear.
            <br> <br>
            After a few hours of nervousness, I finally came up with an idea: a magic trick. A simple act, yet original and powerful enough to impress and enthuse. I spent all day researching and practicing magic tricks to prepare my final act. Time’s up! It was time for me to get up on stage…
            <br> <br>
            My performance was a success. All my classmates were amazed and intrigued to know how I did it. At that moment, after my show, I felt right at home.
            <br> <br>
            That day, I learned some tricks, but the real magic was standing up there watching everyone amazed, moved and inspired; and all from my doing.
            <br> <br>
            Although I did brake magicians’ first rule by sharing my secrets with everyone, I was prouder knowing that because of my sharing, my classmates could experience what I felt.
            <br> <br>
            It’s been a while since my last talent show, but the purpose and results of that performance have turned into my lifelong mission. It is the same conviction that wrote Homer’s stories, painted Dali’s works and shot Tarantino’s films: the aspiration to use one’s voice and vision to impact others.
            <br> <br>
            My magic tricks are not all limited to disappearing cards, however. Using the piano, I experiment with sounds to match my emotions and express them over music. By sharing my music, I intend to conceive and lift others’ humor and mindset. I believe that music’s greatest attribute is its capacity to lift our mood and manipulate our emotions.
            <br> <br>
            Film, too, is another one of my tricks. In 11th grade, as a project for the Communication and Art class, my friends and I recreated a music video. Using what I learned in Digital Photography, I filmed and edited the video for it to resemble the most to the original and to make it as funny as possible. While I did get a rewarding grade, I found greater satisfaction in seeing my classmates laughing and enjoying the video.
            <br> <br>
            I take on education with the same spirit. For me, all learning is research for my next performance–my next “magic trick”; and although my methods of presentation have expanded, the objective of my first trick will stay with me forever. Be it with instruments, cameras or playing cards; through playing music, filming videos, teaching academics or... performing magic tricks, I aim to impact.
            <br> <br>
            To the reader of this text: Do you believe in magic? Invite me to your school and I’ll show you all my tricks.

            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <strong>Favorite Activity/Experience: </strong> <br> <br>
            This year, I discovered my school’s robotics team; and I regret not doing it before. The team’s name is Abtomat
            3480, and it is a part of FIRST (FRC), a world-class robotics organization. <br> <br>
            The team is divided into three main groups: programming, mechanics, and business. I signed up for programming
            and mechanics. For six months, we study the theory behind structures, programs, electronics and any other
            aspect involving robotics. Then, we prepare for the exciting part of the year: the season. <br> <br>
            The season is when all of us integrate our knowledge and work together to build our final piece. In only 6 weeks,
            we have to create a robot that will serve many purposes and will stand out in the competitions, while also
            organizing events, getting sponsors and raising funds for our expenses. <br> <br>
            In only a few months, robotics has become one of my favorite activities. Building in the workshop is both an
            exciting and didactic experience. Last year, my team got to the world cup. This year, our robot will be even better.

            <strong>Why Purdue? </strong> <br> <br>
            Over the last few years, computer science and math have turned into my main interests. As an aspiring software
            developer and system programmer, I see Purdue as a gateway to not just learning but also professional success.
            With the tracks for specialization and the research opportunities that Purdue offers, I would be able to focus
            specifically on my passions for computational science, engineering, and math. I have countless ideas for what I
            could do with my career, and I can’t wait to attend Purdue to learn the skills I need to turn these ideas into fulfilled
            dreams.
            <div class="blank"></div>
            <strong>Why Major? </strong> <br> <br>
            I first encountered computer science when one of my professors introduced me to algorithms, the basis of every
            computer program. Intrigued to know more about it, I spent all afternoon researching and discovered
            programming. At age 15, I connected with the idea of making a computer do whatever I’d want it to. <br> <br>
            I want to pursue Computer Science because of the passion and interest I have for it, but also because, with its
            growing prevalence, there are so many opening opportunities for computer scientists. <br> <br>
            What I like the most about computer science is that you don’t just use, you create.
            <div class="blank"></div>
            <strong>Briefly discuss your reasons for pursuing the second choice major you have selected. (Respond in 100
            words or fewer.) </strong> <br> <br>
            From a young age, I have always felt a connection with numbers. The satisfaction I get from understanding and
            solving a complex problem is incomparable to anything else. Mathematics has always been a subject I greatly
            enjoy and I find it fascinating how it’s present in all aspects of our lives. It is the basis for almost every other
            discipline in the world and its usage is unlimited. <br> <br>
            I want to pursue Mathematics-Computer Science because those are the academic subjects I most relish. With the
            practicability of mathematics and its vast implementations in computer science, professional opportunities are
            almost endless.

            <strong style="font-size: 24px">Short Essays That Got Me Into UC Davis and UC Irvine</strong> <br>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <strong>Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom:</strong> <br> <br>
            For me, computer science is more than just another hobby or activity. Through programming, I am able to implement my ideas and put my knowledge and intelligence to practice. What truly makes me love computer science is that there’s always something new to discover.
            <br> <br>
            I remember my first encounter with computer science. I had heard the term programming before, but I didn’t really understand what it was. Not until one of my professors introduced me to algorithms, the basis of every computer program. Intrigued to know more about it, I spent all afternoon researching algorithms and their potential applications. Then, it appeared before my eyes: code. At age 15, I connected with the idea of making a computer do whatever I’d want it to.
            <br> <br>
            Inside the classroom, I take the opportunity to learn from the experienced and combine that knowledge with my known skills to find applications into real-world issues and implement them to develop exciting projects such as creating an application that helps homes with power consumption, building a website to advertise a business idea or fabricating and programming a drawing robotic arm.
            <br> <br>
            Outside the classroom, I find coding to be my favorite hobby. Taking theory one step further, I constantly read articles or watch videos to find new functions and tools. Then, I experiment with the learned algorithms to create entertainment. Whether it’s making a program to solve my homework, spending late nights coding games to have fun with my friends, or simply going to Best Buy and trying to figure out how new technologies work; there’s always an amusing activity to do with computer science.
            <br> <br>
            In only 2 years, computer science has turned into my main interest. However, there is way much more to it than just programming, and I am eager to learn more about it.

            <strong>Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time:</strong></strong> <br> <br>
            Last October, as an assignment for the Leadership for Social Development class, four of my classmates and I had to create a project that would help solve one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN. Analyzing from my position, goal number 4: Quality Education, was the one we could help the most.
            <br> <br>
            While researching, I found several statistics showing that public education in Mexico falls far behind: more than 4 million children do not attend school and the average level of schooling is disappointingly low. Taking this into consideration, I aimed for those in need.
            I lunged straight into my deepest thoughts, questing for reliable ideas that would possibly improve education. “Do we really need the government's help to have a quality education?”— “Not necessarily”, I thought. With the current tools and online learning platforms, there are so many opportunities to learn.
            <br> <br>
            Accordingly, I decided to focus the project on teaching independent ways of studying. I shared the idea with my classmates and they all agreed with it.
            <br> <br>
            We contacted an educational organization in a low-resource community and arranged a 5-weekend-long course with the objective of teaching how to use the basic features of a computer to utilize different online learning platforms.
            <br> <br>
            We delivered the school assignment on the second week of the month, but the attitude that the students had for learning motivated us to keep on with the lessons.
            <br> <br>
            Throughout this project, I used my leadership abilities not only to build excitement in the students, but also to coordinate and listen to my teammates for them to feel comfortable and compromised.
            <br> <br>
            This experience taught me that being a leader is not all about standing out and having others listen to orders. Rather, being a leader means learning from your mistakes to constantly improve yourself, making everyone feel important and, most importantly, finding pride in the growth of the people around you.
            <br> <br>
            Whether it is for motivating people to study, heading an alliance in a model of the United Nations or helping my classmates achieve their dreams, I am constantly required to be a leader.

            <strong>Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced: </strong> <br> <br>
            From Greek mythology and ancient empires to space odysseys and groundbreaking discoveries, my dad always has a story to tell.
            <br> <br>
            From a young age, I have always been fascinated by my father’s stories. Every time I asked him about why something worked the way it did, or even just a simple doubt on my homework, my dad would find a way to answer my uncertainties by sharing about a marvelous book he read or telling me a funny anecdote from the time he was in school.
            <br> <br>
            Since then, my father has been my role model. He convinced me that learning is my greatest power and he changed my mindset to look at studying as a passion and an opportunity to grow. I take my father to be a very clever and cultured man, and I take advantage of that fact not only by applying what he has taught me inside and outside of school, but also by sharing that knowledge to impact others’ lives. I believe that listening, implementing and sharing others’ life experiences is one of the best ways to learn, improve and impact.
            <br> <br>
            I am aware and grateful for the family I have, the lessons they’ve taught me and the opportunities they have provided me. Not only my father but also my mother, sister and even my friends, because sometimes friend can be your closest family.
            <br> <br>
            The people that surround us are the ones we can learn the most from, and also the ones we can teach the most to. While I do think it is important to focus on academics, I believe that spending time with the people you care about is crucial, because they will be the primary characters for your future stories. They are the ones with whom you’ll create lifelong memories and build your best anecdotes.
            <br> <br>
            This spirit drives me to improve; to always give my best and put myself on the line experimenting and discovering new boundaries. Knowing that my education will someday be my children’s stories, I am constantly motivated to learn.

            <strong style="font-size: 24px">Boston University Waitlist Letter (That Got Me In)</strong> <br>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            Dear Admissions Committee,
            <br> <br>
            I recently received my application decision and found out that I was placed on the waiting list for the 2020-2021 academic year. Thank you for taking the time to carefully review my application. I am happy to have further consideration for admissions and I am writing to express my continued interest in Boston University.
            <br> <br>
            I am particularly drawn to the Mathematics for Computer Science program. As an aspiring software developer, I see Boston University as a gateway to professional success. The flexible curriculum that the BU Hub offers, the exceptional academics, the location and the imposing campus are some of the things that make Boston University one of my top choices.
            <br> <br>
            Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to give some updates on my application. Since I applied to BU, I have been focusing my attention on preserving and improving my grades, exploring my interests and discovering new passions. During my last weeks of in-person high school classes, I worked with the robotics team to finish building the robot before regionals, and I organized a team to participate in an internal soccer tournament; though sadly those activities were left unfinished due to the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the switch to virtual learning, I have had some extra time to raise my GPA to a 97/100 thus far in the semester, and to take part in some courses and events such as Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science and CS50’s puzzle day 2020 (certificate attached).
            <br> <br>
            Thank you again for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Victor Fenton Aguilar
