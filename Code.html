            <h4 id="date">July 21st, 2020/</h4>
            <div class="blank"></div>
            <p>In CS50's Week 5 Problem Set, your task is to implement a spell-checker using a dictionary of words and a hash table.
            "The challenge ahead is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By 'fastest,' though, we’re talking actual
            'wall-clock,' not asymptotic, time". Initially, they provide you with a program that’s designed to spell-check a file
            after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite get around to implementing
            the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) they leave to you!  Here's what I did: <span id="dots2">...</span>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <span class="more" id="more2">In the program that they provide you with, there are three main files, plus some dictionaries
            to work with and some sample texts and keys to test your code. First is speller.c, a program that implements a spell-checker,
            outputting a list of all the words misspelled in a file, plus some statistics on the number of words and the time to run each
            part of your program. The spell-checker works by taking each word in an inputted file, running it through your program, and
            checking if that word with its specific spelling is found in a hashed dictionary. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in
            a file called dictionary.c. (As programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes
            for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in dictionary.c itself but in dictionary.h instead. That way, both speller.c
            and dictionary.c can #include the file. Here's a more detailed explanation of the problem by CS50's own Brian Yu:
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_z57x5PGF4w" class="devimg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            In short, you need to implement 5 functions: a load function, to load the contents of the dictionary into memory;
            a hash function (perhaps the most important part of the problem), to perform some sort of operation on a word to
            determine its hash code, that in this case is going to be the index of our hash table in which we are going to
            insert that specific word; a size function, to count the number of words in the dictionary; a check function, to
            determine if a word is misspelled or not using, again, the hash function; and an unload function, to free all the
            memory previously allocated for our data structure. We'll review my implementation for each of these functions:
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparations.-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            Before we start implementing the functions, we need to #include all the libraries that we are going to need throughout
            the problem. Also, we need to initialize our hash table, define the structure of every node in our table, each of which
            consists of one chunk of memory to store a word, plus another chunk to store a pointer to the next item in our index, in
            case we get any collisions. Finally, we initialize the variables for the count of words in our dictionary and the number
            of buckets in our hash table. We'll get back to explaining these later.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>

            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Load() .-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            To load each word in the dictionary into the computer's memory and organize the words in our hash table, I first declared an
            array to temporarily store each word from the dictionary. The array's length is set to the maximum length that an English
            word can have (previously defined as 45) + 1 for the null terminating character of a string. Then, we open the file of the
            dictionary (with "r" for read mode), checking if no errors were presented, and start the process of copying every word from
            the dictionary to our word array, and into our hash table. <br>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <img src="pictures/Devlog2[2].png" alt="Photo of Code Section 2" class="devimg"></img>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            To do this, I used a while loop that uses fscanf to copy from the dictionary (*d), each word (%s for string), into our word_array
            as long as we have not reached the end of the file. Once inside the loop, we call a secondary function to create a new node with
            that word in our hash table, initializing its *next pointer to NULL. Then, we run our node's word through the hash function
            (later explained) to get the specific index of our hash table in which we'll insert the node. Now that the node is created and we
            know where we should put it, we set the *next pointer of our node to point to the head of the list at the desired index, and then
            change the head of the list to be the current node. This will take care of keeping everything connected, creating a linked list in
            the indexes where multiple nodes collide. Finally, we increment the word count after we've added each word. When we're finished, we
            close the dictionary file and return true if no errors where found.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Size() .-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            No rocket science in this one. Since we had already counted the words that we added to the table in load(), we simply return the
            word_count variable.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <img src="pictures/Devlog2[3].png" alt="Photo of Code Section 3" class="devimg"></img>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Hash() .-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            This is where it gets interesting. My implementation of this function is what mainly differs my program from any other person's
            implementation of speller. This is what determines the running time of my spell-checker. The purpose of a hash function is to take
            a word and return which index into our hash table we should use in order to find insert that word into our data structure.
            This function must be deterministic, meaning that it will always return the same hash code when provided the same input multiple times.
            Also, we should try to make it as efficient as we can, balancing between running time and memory, but prioritizing time. Since a hash
            table is an array where elements in the same indexes group in a linked list, we should try to make the hash codes as unique as we can,
            so that we can search for word using the random access provided by arrays instead of searching for them inside of linked lists. In other
            words, we should try our best to avoid collisions between words' indexes. <br>
            <br>
            What I first though about was to take the ascii sum for all the letters in the word and substract 97 from that number, so that the
            smallest-value word ("a") would get the index 0. Since the largest allowed length for a word is 45 characters and the largest ascii
            value for a letter (z) is 122, that would give 5490 buckets for our hash table, but a word with 45 z's in a row seemed a bit excessive,
            so I decided that 4900 buckets was enough. While this seemed to perform decently, the running time wasn't as fast as I would want it to
            be and we were still getting many collisions, so I took that same value and multiplied it by the index of the first letter of the word
            (by index I mean 0 for a, 1 for b, etc...). Although this did make the program a little faster, some new collisions were also created.
            To avoid these new collisions and get even better results, I twitched the operation a little bit and, in addition to multiplying by the index
            of the first letter, I multiplied that index by 4900, avoiding any new collisions and spreading out the new values. Yes, this resulted in a
            lot more buckets (127,400 to be exact) and a lot of empty ones, but the performance was much greater, even as fast as the CS50's staff
            implementation almost, so I decided the memory wasted was worth the price.

            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            These are some examples of my program's running time compared to the staff's solution:

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>

            <ul>
                <li><strong> Check() .-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            For the check() function, I simply ran the inputted word through our hash function and created a pointer called cursor that would
            iterate through every element of the hash table at the index returned by the hash function, pointing to every node's word and
            comparing it to the inputted word. If a matching word is found, we would return true. If we got to the end of the linked list (NULL)
            and found no matches, then the program would return false.

            <ul>
                <li><strong> Unload() .-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            Lastly, to free all the memory allocated for our data structure, I created two pointers and used them in every bucket of our hash table,
            setting the pointers equal to the last and second-to-last elements of the linked list, freeing each node and running them back until
            every element of the index was cleared. If all the process is completed without encountering errors, the program returns true.

                <li><strong> Conclusion.-</strong></li>
            </ul>
            I found this problem to be somewhat challenging but amusing without a doubt. It was really fun to code and to watch it run and compete
            against others' implementations. I submitted my solution to CS50's Speller Big Board and got in 1209th place, a big number, but still
            a good result considering that my code's running time was almost as fast as the staff's implementation (and even faster in the smaller
            text samples!), and that millions of people have taken CS50 and implemented this problem. Overall, I am really pleased with the experience
            of solving this problem and with my implementation's results. I learned a lot about data structures and programming in general, and I am
            happy that my program even made it into the Big Board!<br>

            <h1 class="entry-title">Python x Tkinter Elevator Animation</h1>
            <h4 id="date">July 17th, 2020/</h4>
            <div class="blank"></div>
            <p>I developed this small project back in December, while on vacation, because I had just found out about Graphical User
            Interfaces (or GUIs for short) and I wanted to get my head around how to use them, so after I found out that one of the most
            popular GUI modules was Tkinter and learning the basics of it, one of my first ideas to test it was to make a small interactive
            animation of an elevator in which you could click the buttons for each floor and watch the simple elevator drawing move to your
            selected floor in real time. Here's what I did: <span id="dots1">...</span>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <span class="more" id="more1">I started by downloading and importing Tkinter, creating a window for the GUI and styling it
            with basic geometry and colors. I then went on to learn how to create basic lines and shapes, along with text elements,
            buttons, labels, canvas, and more simple features to include inside my interface's window.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <img src="pictures/Devlog1[1].png" alt="Photo of Code Section 1" class="devimg"></img>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            This took care of the "design" of the window, title, and a drawing of a building with a small elevator in it and multiple floors
            from PB (more commonly L for Lobby) to a 7th floor. The second part was the coding of the buttons for every floor. For this,
            I created a small space at the bottom of the window labeled "Buttons", where I laid out 8 evenly-spaced-out yellow buttons. <br>
            <br>
            In Tkinter, buttons take a "command" parameter to specify an action to perform whenever that specific button is clicked. However, when
            running my program, I found that the elevator started moving under the command of every button without the user even pressing on a
            button! To fix this, I found that you can use the python "lambda" function, which gives you an anonymous function that is taken as a
            command for a button and handles the code running itself. After testing this fix, I wrote the corresponding "command = lambda:
            move(floor_number)" for each of the eight yellow buttons, and it turned out to work just fine.
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            <img src="pictures/Devlog1[2].png" alt="Photo of Code Section 2" class="devimg" style="width: 100%"></img>
            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            Then came the actual programming of the buttons, the genuine "coding" of not the structure, or the style, but the back-end functioning
            of the interactions of the user with the buttons. To make this work, I used three main parts: a variable depicting the current floor in
            which the elevator is, a variable to determine whether the elevator is moving or not, and a move() function that moves the elevator a
            certain amount of distance depending on which floor the user wants to get to. <br>
            <br>
            Inside the move() function, I used the "moving" variable to state that the function can only perform operations when the elevator has stopped
            moving or hasn't started moving. Then, I used the "current_floor" variable and compared it to the function's parameter (the user's desired floor)
            to determine whether the elevator is going to move upwards or downwards. I calculated the number of floors that the elevator has to move in order
            to get to the user's desired floor and started the operation: The "moving" variable is set to 1 to determine that the elevator is now moving, and
            then a simple for loop takes care of the actual moving of the elevator drawing in the GUI to the desired floor. At the end of the process, the
            "moving" variable is set back to 0 to state that the elevator has stopped movement, and the "current_floor" variable is updated to the floor number
            that the elevator is now in.

            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            Finally, at the end of the program, we write the line "mainloop()" to allow the tkinter window to run in real time:

            <div class="smallblank"></div>
            This project was simple yet very fun to develop and definitely useful to get my head around the basic functions of animation and
            graphical user interfaces in python. The code is a bit messy (specially due to all the sketching of the lines and shapes
            in the coordinates of the window), and I'm sure there is a lot of room for optimization, but for a first run with Tkinter, I am
            pretty happy with how it turned out to look and work. Who knows? I might get back to the project later and give it an upgrade. <br>
            <br>
